This is a simulation project for the paper "Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits Without
Sacrificing Expressibility".

I followed the circuit in Figure 1 (c) of the paper exactly to replicate the experiment, and the results were similar to those reported in the paper.

However, when I used StronglyEntanglingLayers to test the effectiveness of the gadget layer (MPQC), the results were not satisfactory. This may indicate that MPQC does not provide immediate effective improvements in all scenarios and requires deeper understanding.
